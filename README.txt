Instructions for TA ZongXing Xie,

       I'm pretty sure you already know all this since you're a pro. But here it is nonetheless:

1) Extract the files from the zip file using 7zip or Winrar.
2)Open simple_shell_SI.c file using any editor(notepad, notepad++, atmel, visual studio) etc.
3) You can read my comments for each system call, including the extra credit ones. 
4) Select all (ctrl + a) and copy (ctrl + c) the source code. Paste the code in gedit on linux. 
5) Compile on a Linux machine, or using PuTTy gcc test.c -o test
6) Run code ./test
7) shell$ should be displayed on console
8) You can test the examples given in the Proj1 manual on black board. 

Have a nice day!
Thanks, 
Shahzod.
